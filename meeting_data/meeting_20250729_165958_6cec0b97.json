  "transcript": "Speaker A: Start. Okay, so in last class we were creating a agent. But the problem was with the embedding. Okay, so what I did Ola, my embedding was still showing some problems and all. So I instead of olama embedding, I had used over there open AI embedding. Okay, that LLM is olama. Okay, LLM I kept as olama only what I change, I change the embedding. Okay? Embedding can be anything. So I thought like if. Hola, My embedding is not working as of now because maybe some reason behind it. So I just use some other embedding. So in case one of the embedding is not working for you, you can definitely try with other embeddings, right? So if it will start, we can just open it up in localhost 3000. Okay, so this is what we were creating, right? Okay, so now what happened here? The problem was over here, right? Whole arm embedding was not work. So I replaced all our embedding with open embedding. Rest everything I kept as it is. Okay, here I uploaded a file. The text file in which the sample meal. Okay, sample meal was what? Like how generally what is the style of writing a meal? Like, you know how I want, how I write a meal. So this file I had shared with you. I'll again show you this one. It is sample spelling is wrong. Anyway, that is okay, so if you see over here, I have a file over a sample mill, right? So now I'll launch it. So here is something, right? How I generally write a. I already shown you again the three agents already. I like the prom for three agents. Also we created, okay, using our prompt engineering team, right? And thereafter what are we doing? Okay, so file is uploaded, chunking is done. Embedding we are doing through open embedding. Because all I'm embedding is something which is not working better as of now, maybe some update going on. Then we have a vector database retriever tool and everything is connected to the worker. That means when I will give the mail to this guy, the worker first I'll give this the mail to this guy. It will summarize. It will summarize. Then it will go to Worker 2. The Worker 2 will do what? That is email responder. It will read the content that how generally I write a mail and it will follow the same style to write a mail, give it to the next guy, until finally save it. All right, so this process is done. Let's try to use it. Okay, so to use it, everything is saved over here. Okay. Absurd. You can see absurd was not working in last class. I tried it but there may be some problem going on. So now here Absurd is working. Okay. So now I'll open up the chat. Okay. I'll just type a simple mail. Let's say suppose someone mailed me. Okay. Let's say hello. So here I had given the name as Arun. Okay. Like in the prompt I had given that this is a agent created by Arun. Right? So hello Arun. I hope this message finds you well. Okay. I am in your AI course. Okay. Can you explain me once again what What a LLM is? Okay. Thereafter. Best regards. Okay, so here I missed one thing. Let me just try to do this. That. Okay, here I actually missed one important information to be used. There is no problem. I can use any number of times. Report is free. So basically suppose the person who had mailed me is J. Okay.",
  "summary": {
    "summary": "Speaker A hosted a meeting to discuss issues with embedding in their AI course. They replaced all embedding with open embedding and chunking is done. Embedding is now being done through open embedding, as some embeddings are not working better due to updates. The vector database retriever tool and everything are connected to the worker. When Speaker A gives a mail to the first worker, it will summarize and then pass it to the second worker (Email Responder) for reading the content in the same style as Speaker A's mail and following the same format to write a mail until finally saving it.",
