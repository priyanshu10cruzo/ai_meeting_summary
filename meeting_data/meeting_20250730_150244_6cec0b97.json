  "transcript": "Speaker A: Start. Okay, so in last class we were creating a agent. But the problem was with the embedding. Okay, so what I did Ola, my embedding was still showing some problems and all. So I instead of olama embedding, I had used over there open AI embedding. Okay, that LLM is olama. Okay, LLM I kept as olama only what I change, I change the embedding. Okay? Embedding can be anything. So I thought like if. Hola, My embedding is not working as of now because maybe some reason behind it. So I just use some other embedding. So in case one of the embedding is not working for you, you can definitely try with other embeddings, right? So if it will start, we can just open it up in localhost 3000. Okay, so this is what we were creating, right? Okay, so now what happened here? The problem was over here, right? Whole arm embedding was not work. So I replaced all our embedding with open embedding. Rest everything I kept as it is. Okay, here I uploaded a file. The text file in which the sample meal. Okay, sample meal was what? Like how generally what is the style of writing a meal? Like, you know how I want, how I write a meal. So this file I had shared with you. I'll again show you this one. It is sample spelling is wrong. Anyway, that is okay, so if you see over here, I have a file over a sample mill, right? So now I'll launch it. So here is something, right? How I generally write a. I already shown you again the three agents already. I like the prom for three agents. Also we created, okay, using our prompt engineering team, right? And thereafter what are we doing? Okay, so file is uploaded, chunking is done. Embedding we are doing through open embedding. Because all I'm embedding is something which is not working better as of now, maybe some update going on. Then we have a vector database retriever tool and everything is connected to the worker. That means when I will give the mail to this guy, the worker, first I'll give this the mail to this guy. It will summarize. It will summarize. Then it will go to Worker 2. The Worker 2 will do what? That is email responder. It will read the content that how generally I write a mail and it will follow the same style to write a mail, give it to the next guy, until finally save it. All right, so this process is done. Let's try to use it. Okay, so to use it, everything is saved over here. Okay. Absurd. You can see absurd was not working in last class. I tried it but there may be some problem going on. So now here Absurd is working. Okay. So now I'll open up the chat. Okay. I'll just type a simple mail. Let's say suppose someone mailed me. Okay. Let's say hello. So here I had given the name as Arun. Okay. Like in the prompt I had given that this is a agent created by Arun. Right? So hello Arun. I hope this message finds you well. Okay. I am in your AI course. Okay. Can you explain me once again what What a LLM is? Okay. Thereafter. Best regards. Okay, so here I missed one thing. Let me just try to do this. That. Okay, here I actually missed one important information to be used. There is no problem. I can use any number of times. Report is free. So basically suppose the person who had mailed me is J. Okay.",
  "summary": {
    "summary": "The meeting discussed the creation and improvement of an AI agent, specifically the embedding and open AI embedding used. The team also worked on a vector database retriever tool and connected everything to the worker. The process involved creating an agent using prompt engineering, uploading a file, chunking, and doing open embedding. Additionally, they discussed the use of absurd, which was not working in the previous class but is now working. The team also talked about explaining LLMs and how to write a mail in the AI course.",

    "notes": "& Follow-ups: None specified in transcript\n\nHOT SPOTS:\n\n* Embedding issues: Speaker A mentioned that the embedding was not working properly, and they replaced it with open AI embedding.\n* Absurd: Speaker A tried absurd but encountered some problems, but now it is working.\n* LLMs: Speaker A explained what LLMs are and how to write a mail in the AI course.\n\nCOMMENTS & INSIGHTS:\n\n* The team faced an embedding issue, which they resolved by using open AI embedding. This highlights the importance of troubleshooting and finding solutions to technical problems.\n* Absurd was not working in the previous class but is now working, indicating that issues can be resolved with time and effort.\n* LLMs are an essential part of the AI course, and understanding how to write a mail in this context is crucial for effective communication.\n\nOVERALL MEETING FLOW: The meeting discussed various aspects of creating and improving an AI agent, including embedding, open AI embedding, vector database retriever tool, worker, absurd, LLMs, and writing a mail in the AI course. The team encountered some issues but found solutions through troubleshooting and perseverance."
